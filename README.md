Instructions
----

Using the particle.io IDE at http://build/particle.io

search for this library, "Use This Example"

WEIRD BUG. MAKE SURE YOU CHANGE THE FILE SLIGHTLY AND SAVE IT BEFORE IT WILL COMPILE. (I add a blank line)

flash to your Photon one of the two examples in the example folder.

a01-pixy-d7.ino

a02-pixy-serial.ino

Note: you need to teach the Pixy about a color to identify. See this website.
